            /*
             * There are two main options for output in a console:
             * Write() and WriteLine()
             * WriteLine() adds a line break after your output.
             * Write() does not.
             * 
             * There are 3 options for Input in console.
             * 
             * Read() - Only takes 1 keystroke of input and stores the ascii value
             * of that key.
             * ReadKey() - Similar idea, but captures the key's character value 
             *             The book uses this method to halt their program.
             * ReadLine() - Most common. It allows the user to input something
             *              and reads the input as a string after they hit enter.
             *              
             * The important part is capturing or using the information they gave you.

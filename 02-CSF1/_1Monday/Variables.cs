             * 3. Web Services - These are distributed applications.

                VARIABLES:
                A variable is just a container to hold information. Just like
                any other container, its contents can be changed. Since C# is
                a type-safe language, all variables must have an assigned datatype.
                The datatype cannot be changed in the code (programmatically).

                Declaration: Creating the variable. This requires a datatype and a name.

                Assignment: Giving a variable a value, or changing the value.

                Initialization: Assigning a value the FIRST time.

             * DateTime is a class from the FCL (Framework Class Library)
             * that we can use as a datatype to create variables that
             * hold date and time information.
             * 
             * Time defaults to 12am.
             * 
             * This is a complex datatype, unlike bools, ints, etc
             * which are all intrinsic/simple datatypes.
             * 
             * Complex datatypes often need the "new" keyword (just like collections)
             * and a constructor method, which has the same name as the datatype.
             * 
             * string[] colors = new string[5];
             * 
             * Syntax for DateTime:
             * DateTime x = new DateTime();
             * 
             * Format Specifiers for DateTime:
             * (d, D, M, t, T, f, F)
